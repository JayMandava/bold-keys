# Cloud colour UI gates

The feature-only `Android colour UI QA` workflow validates the real Android IME,
not just the Appearance preview. It runs only on `feat/iconic-colours` in the
public upstream repository, with read-only repository permission, no production
environment or signing secrets, a 45-minute job limit, and one-day artifacts.
It does not publish or trigger the protected release workflow.

## Prerequisites and fail-closed behaviour

The hosted runner must already have effective read/write access to `/dev/kvm`.
The workflow records the user and device permissions and stops if that is not
true. It never changes ACLs, groups, udev rules or security policy, and never
runs the emulator as root. SDK installation uses official packages and already
accepted licenses; stdin is closed rather than accepting new agreements.

The API 35 Google APIs x86_64 image must report ARM64 translation so that the
normal ARM64 APK can run unchanged. Boot has a ten-minute bound. A failed boot
or absent capability is a blocked runtime gate, not an application test pass.

## Coverage and evidence

The build stage runs both JVM variants, both lint variants, release tooling
tests, an unsigned release build, and debug/test APK builds. The instrumentation
uses a debug-only synthetic editor plus the real setup screen. It verifies:

- All five explicit palettes through labelled choices, accessible selected
  state, reopening settings and applying the choice to both real IME surfaces.
- Real key touches, Shift, delete, cursor movement and Shift-trackpad selection;
  repeated symbol/emoji opening and dismissal.
- Portrait and landscape, explicit colours under light/dark system appearance,
  Match phone, larger text, and independent backlight preferences.
- Text, search, email, URL, password and numeric fields, including the existing
  private-field suggestion rules and URL/email/password no-replacement behaviour.

`palette-*-portrait-real-app.png` shows the real setup screen and connected IME.
`qa-*` images use the clearly labelled synthetic test host. Neither contains
user data. PNGs, view hierarchies, per-test result JSON, failure evidence, device
properties, source SHA and APK hashes are retained together. Optional raw MP4
recordings must be decoded and visually reviewed before use; a passing UI test
does not certify successful video encoding.

The debug test activity is excluded from the release APK. Successful debug
instrumentation establishes runtime behaviour for the shared production code,
but does not replace production certificate, fresh-download or protected
release-workflow verification.
